# Tattoo Flavored Alchemist
The goal of this is to flavor/homebrew the Artificer/Alchemist into a support class that brews magical ink to imbue spells and stat bonuses to the character and their party

---
## Level 1
Just flavor changes:
### Casting:
-  Alchemists are half-casters that must prepare spells daily. Expending a spell slot would be the equivalent of expending the magic imbued in the ink, and long rests enable me to re-imbue or touch-up tattoos to "prepare" them.
- Cantrips contain weak enough magic that they don't need to be touched up.

### Tools:
- Calligraphy tools can be re-flavored to a tattoo kit that includes needles and a machine.
- Glassblowers tools include the molds for various inks and glassware for their development

---
## Level 2
### Infuse Item:
- Artificer Infusions can be flavored as "tattoos" - tattooist tools can etch magical ink into most surfaces assuming they do not have some kind of magical protection/resistance.

---
## Level 3
### Artificer Specialist:
- Here we take the Alchemist specialization where our alchemy will be flavored as experimental and magically infused inks.

### Right tools right job:
- This will be used with long rests to ensure I have a steady stream of needles and basic ink to be imbued, think this is a fair trade-off instead of being able to generate *any* toolset and magically gaining proficiency

### Experimental Elixer:
- Mechanically very similar, will still roll off the experimental elixer table.
- Flavored as ink vials instead of potions. Ink vials can be thrown/consumed by an action, or used as a bonus action if tattooed onto the user.
If a user is incompacitated they can not activate a tattoo (ex: this wouldn't function as an auto-heal)
- Can instead spend a spell slot to imbue ink with a specific effect from the experimental elixer table

---
## Level 4
Just abitlity score / feat upgrade.

---
## Level 5

### Experimental Elixer:
- Can now spend a spell slot to imbue ink with that spell. Can only be done a number of times equal to my proficiency bonus.

### Alchemical Savant:
- Can be reflavored to Ink Master or something similar
- Instead of boosting damage/healing, I think it would be cool to have more versatility by allowing me to learn some of the magical tattoos from TCE. [Link here](https://dnd-5e.fandom.com/wiki/Magic_Tattoos)
- Each "rank" of tattoo (common - legendary) costs +1 point over the previous tier, and I can only give tattoos of a point value equal to my profieciency bonus. These tattoos can only be given during rests (common/uncommon = short rest, all larger tattoos require a long rest.)
- Only one tattoo of a given type can be imbued at a time except for spellwrought tattoos
- Spellwrought tattoos can only be given for spells/cantrips that I *know*

---
## Level 6
- Nothing Changes, just makes me better at using non-tattoo tools

---
## Level 7
- Nothing changes

---
## Level 8
- Ability score/feat

---
## Level 9
### Restorative Reagents:
- Functions the same. Tattooed experimental elixers don't benefit, only if the ink is consumed.

- Can cast lesser restoration using a tattoo needle as the focus, or imbue it into ink (does go against tattoo limit)

---
## Level 10
### Magical Item Adept:
- Can still attune up to 4 magical items
- Instead of having cheaper crafts for magical items, I can tattoo two common, or one uncommon tattoos for free (i.e doesn't count towards alchemical savant)

---
## Level 11
### Spell-Storing Item
- Can be re-flavored as "Fortified" magical ink
- Mechanically the same except the object is a tattoo that will not fade upon use like normal spell-imbued inks
