# Flavor and Spells

## Off-brand spells
I think wildemount is considered "partnered" content, not an official source, but these two spells fit the flavor really well and I would like to use them if allowed.

## Flavor
Aryn is obsessed with mastering conjuration specifically. He wants to find or create a spell powerful enough to tear straight into the feywilds and free his mentor, so it feels really on-brand to flavor some of his (non-conjuration) spells around conjuration/teleportation.

Because of his connection to the feywilds and his unorthodox training, I also want to give his magic a bit of a mischevious or chaotic flare to really sell this feeling that Aryn is not the traditional model of what a "wizard" should be.

### Spellbook
- Aryn's spellbook is not a traditional tome of arcane knowledge. He has a sack of loose parchment scraps with his research written on them.
    - My sort of "theory" on how this works is that he's subconciously conjuring the "right" bit of parchment any time he reaches in to find them. 
    - Copying spells is still the same, he just writes it down on a scrap of parchment and tosses it in the bag.

### Spell flavor
The assumption is that any "flavoring" of spells doesn't change the way they work mechanically, but I still wanted to get approval / buy-in for Aryn's magic to be themed around teleportation.

Not every spell needs special sauce, so I'll note the ones that I think are interesting.

### Cantrips
- Mage Hand
    - I imagine the hand would be a small fairy-like creature conjured by Aryn (still abiding by the standard mage hand rules/limitations).
- Lightning Lure
    - I really like this cantrip, it opens a lot of doors for us with flavor and tactics. 
    - I envision this to be sort of like "conjuring" someone into Aryn. Space warps around them and spits them out 10 feet closer, still doing lightning damage (maybe they traveled through a plane of lightning, or just because.)

### 1st Level
- Catapult
    - I really enjoy the idea of being able to conjure some mundane object and then catapulting it. RAW that would be 2 actions, but it dispells whatever my last conjuration was AND disappears when it inflicts damage.
    - Would not abuse this to conjure acid or alchemist fire to try and cheese more damage
    - I wish this was a conjuration spell so I did not have to take ice knife

### 2nd Level
- Levitate
    - I imagine warping them up 20 feet, then having a part of the item (or more likely part of a person) to be stuck in some sort of little wormhole that I can use to move them around.
