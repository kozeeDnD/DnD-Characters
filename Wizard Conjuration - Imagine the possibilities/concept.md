# The concept
The thought behind this character is for them to be a seeker of knowledge. As a young man they slipped through an unseen portal to the feywilds, and his brief visit left an impression. He now has the (limited) ability to slip through the cracks between the material plane and feywilds to teleport, and he is now on a journey to understand conjuration magic, with a focus on the layer of worlds that wrap around the material plane.

Because of his encounter, he is not traditionally trained by a magical college, and he does not have good will or connections to most mages, he may even have bad feelings towards "guild" mages that are part of an order/hierarchy - though it may be helpful to introduce a mentor (from the material plane, or possibly even from the fey wilds).

His spell book, and conjuration magic aren't traditional - his spell book is a leather bag bound with various sylvan runes, and inside are scraps of parchment and vellum with knowledge scrawled hastily. He can reach into the bag to conjure items - and often does so, but is capable of conjuring directly into unoccupied spaces. (Mechanically the bag is NOT a bag of holding, and can not store any items. Anything put into the bag would immediately fall through, or otherwise be shunted out of the material plane.)
(Fun fact - a wizard's spell book is not considered inherently magical. Can I conjure a copy of my "book" if I ever needed it?)

For a plot hook - the character will most likely be interested in delving down to find rare items, or spell scrolls to study - he wont need much convincing to join and cooperate with a friendly, competent party.

## Concerns
* Teleportation magic is inherently (mostly) defensive - forced movement is pretty rare outside of vortex warp (which pretty specifically can not be used to warp people into danger in most cases).
* Running out of spell slots turns me into a wet noodle and I fear that a megadungeon may not have a ton of long rest opportunities (or downtime to learn new spells for that matter).

# Character details

## Personality
This character is intelligent and skilled - eager to share their knowledge, but not always understanding of the proper time and place. They crave personal freedom, and don't necessarily trust those who come from nobility or other forms of institutional power.

## Background
Aryn was a pretty normal young man when he mistakenly slipped into the feywilds - or perhaps he was lured in by a friendly entity? Regardless, he was incredibly lucky to stumble upon an Adventurer (likely a sorcerer or wizard himself) that fed him and kept him alive for a while. 
Over time Aryn's body adapted to the feywilds in unique ways - allowing him to slip back into the material plane, though only for brief seconds at best. He has learned to use these "cracks" in the fabric of space to effectively teleport short distances, as well as other bits of magic from his mentor along the way, becoming enamoured with the planes and magic more generally in the process.

Finding transportation back to the material plane was not a quick process. In the span of years spent there Aryn grew to be an exceptionally intelligent young man said to be able to memorize just about anything after a glance. His magical prowess continued to grow under the watchful eye of his mentor, and his affinity for conjuration becoming more apparent with each passing day.
Once a passage back to the material plane was located Aryn packed eagerly for the journey - his mentor did not. The mentor confided in Aryn that he was not permitted to leave the feywilds, a cruel condition of a favor he asked from the Fey long ago - and so Aryn returned to the material plane alone.

There are always consequences for traveling through the feywilds unprepared, and Aryn is no exception. Not only had several years passed, but he was shunted out somewhere mear Misty Forest - a long way from home in Neverwinter. Aryn naturally wished to return to Neverwinter to find his parents, but quickly understood the world was very different. He recalled the advise his mentor departed with - find curious minds, seek adventure, and become a great wizard.

So Aryn tried - and was rejected by any magical institution that he could find. He was too unpredictable - his magic unorthodox and improper, and his spell "book" a mockery of tradition. Aryn regrets his return to the material plane, and now seeks to carve his own path back to the feywilds - preferably with a spell, or other magic powerful enough to free his mentor from his Fey bindings.

# Gameplay
The intent of this character broadly is to use their knowledge to use their mastery of conjuration to put the right person in the right place with the right tool. A swiss army knife of spells and physical conjurations that can aleviate some of the difficulty of traversing a (presumably) resource-taxing dungeon.

## Out of combat
OOC this character is intended to be pretty good at the intelligence stats - they're a smarty pants that likes to solve problems. They wont be a great party face or leader, but definitely can converse and even charm a bit if needed. Their value lies in their ability to identify their team-members' strengths, and conjuring up the tools they need to amplify those strengths (or shore up weaknesses).

## Combat
This character is all about control. They have catapult (better flavor) and ice knife (better damage, plus conjuration to reset benign teleportation), but most of their other spell options are going to be about controlling the flow of battle by teleporting allies in/out, or using spells to hamper enemies. There is some potential to pair minor conjuration with combat by summoning acid or poison vials, but it will mostly just fill a niche.

# Minor Conjuration
The feature is super vague, but an important tool as it allows us to produce essentially one niche item at a time to help with whatever possible. Understanding the limitations of what I can do with this are essential to determining how it plays out. Below are assertions that may change, but seem reasonable.

## Can conjure:
- uncostly spell components
- Basic poison, acid, or alchemical fire (assuming I have studied it at some point in time)
- mundane items (ball bearings, caltrops, weapons or other objects within the size requirement)

## Can't conjure
- Costly/rare spell components
- Ingredients to potions or inks
- Unique/rare chemicals
