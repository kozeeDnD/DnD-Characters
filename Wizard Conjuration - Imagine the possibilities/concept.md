# The concept

The thought behind this character is for them to be a seeker of knowledge - they want to understand not only magic, but the rules that govern the physical "mundane" world around them. Their knowledge and intimate understanding of items is how they replicate them through raw magic.

To have this character operate at a passable level, it does require some DM buy-in. My initial idea is that in addition to typical adventuring gear and "simple" items - I'll have the base knowledge to generate a small pool of "special" items - such as a vial of basic poison, a flask of oil, alchemists fire, ect. (We can iron out exactly how many of these I can have, and the limitations on them). Over time I'd like to be able to study and re-create more valuable items. Higher level poisons, spell components, possibly even some simple traps. (Only after obtaining or finding a way to spend meaningful time with them first.)

This knowledge seeking could be specifically why they are delving into the dungeon - he is looking for a specific spell, or substance and its rumoured to be available somewhere within the dungeon.

## Gameplay
The intent of this character broadly is to use their knowledge to conjure the right tool for the right job. Not just for themselves, but for their party as they delve into a deep, and presumably resource-taxing dungeon.

## Out of combat
OOC this character is intended to be pretty good at the intelligence stats - they're a smarty pants that likes to solve problems. They wont be a great party face or leader, their value lies in their ability to identify their team-members' strengths, and conjuring up the tools they need to amplify those strengths (or shore up weaknesses).

## Combat
This character requires a bit of set-up, which I think makes it feel more fair.

 It requires a turn for me to conjure my poison and set up my familiar, and then a "knockdown" turn where I'm able to fire off some damage. Alternatively I'll be managing some battlefield tempo with teleportation and other control options. The character isn't meant to dominate the battlefield, but I think it'll hold its own especially if I get the opportunity to snatch some spell scrolls.
 - It would be cool if I could teach my fey summon to administer poisons to its own weapons, or even my allies weapons, but I understand that being a bit outside of scope.



# Minor Conjuration
The feature is super vague and is the crux of this build. Understanding the limitations of what I can do with this are essential to determining:
- if the build is worth playing
- how I go about certain choices

## Mechanics

To help balance out and curtail some of the more ridiculous items, both of my feats are primarily "flavor" feats / feats that explicitly provide an explaination of why my character is capable of conjuring complex objects. (Keen mind and Poisoner are the feats in mind).

### Simple Items
- Common adventuring gear, or other items typical people would come across in daily life.
    - Basic weapons/armor (assuming fits size req), Rope, Boxes/Crates/Jugs, Paper or a Quill, ect.

### Special Items
- Less common, but still non-magical items that every-day people would not easily be able to purchase or acquire.
    - Poison, Alchemists fire, rare inks and dyes for my spell book, a gilded flower, a crystal vial, ect.


### Questions
- Am I able to replicate liquids or other "substances" that are not necessarily a discreet item on their own? For example, could I replicate a "bag of caltrops" - or can I only produce one? Similarly, a "vial of X" or "flagon of Y" after posessing or otherwise studying said item? 

- Are conjured items suitable for paying the component cost of items?
    -   What (if any) restrictions are placed here? Can "conjured" items be consumed, or only "used" as part of the ritual/spell?
    - Is there a limit to the value of the items I can conjure?
    - Could this be expanded to non-magical ingredients? (i.e potion ingredients that aren't inherently magical, but contribute to magical potions)
