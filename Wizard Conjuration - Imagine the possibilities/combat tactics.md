# Combat Tactics / Ideas

The main goal of this is to go over a few thoughts I have one what Aryn will do in combat.

Aryn is mostly a controller, but will skip (some) traditional aoe control spells in favor of the teleportation flavoring. 

Aryn is going to focus a lot on managing the positioning of himself and his allies, as well as mucking up enemy action economy.

I really wanted a level or two in warlock to get eldritch blast and the push/pull incantations. Flavoring them as short "warps" would be SO cool, but it delays spell progression (and we already have a lock so I don't want to bite on one of their defining features.)

## Benign Teleportation Engine
This is basically the core of the build. I can teleport, or swap places with an ally, and it refreshes every time I cast a leveled conjuration spell.

### Interactions
- Benign teleport isn't a spell, so I can use it to swap places, then refresh it with misty step for some pretty insane mobility.

- I can also refresh it with Ice Knife, though I cant teleport the same turn. Between this and misty step I have effectively 8 (7 spell slots + 1 at-will cast) refreshes per long-rest.

- I can use normal movement or misty step to get in range of an enemy, then swap in a martial class.

### Questions
- "you can't use it again until you finish a long rest or you cast a conjuration spell of 1st level or higher."
    - Do I have to spend a spell slot? I.e, will rituals or "at will" casts refresh this?
- Two limitations are a bit concerning, the range and creature size - I'm hoping we can homebrew (or otherwise figure out) a way for me to loosen those restrictions.

## Vortex Warp / Pulse Wave / Gravity Sinkhole

### Questions
- Do hazards like "web" count as occupied space?

## Lightning Lure
My poor-man's eldritch blast. This is going to be my niche, repeatable forced movement option. Any turn I don't have a more important action to cast I can use this to pull an enemy to me and deal some damage.
