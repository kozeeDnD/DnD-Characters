# Spell Planner (1-10)
Will add to this as I plan/level up, obviously subject to change as we adapt to our campaign and party needs.

# Level 1:
At level 1 we get a few additional spells known due to our Abberant Mind origin, and as a Variant Human we're also taking telekenetic feat.
- S/O = Sorcerer Origin

## Cantrips:
- Prestidigiatation
- Friends
- Chill Touch
- Mending
- Mind Sliver (S/O)
- Mage Hand (Feat)

## Level 1 Spells (2 slots)
- Arms of Hadar (S/O)
- Dissonant Whispers (S/O)
- Shield
- Disguise Self

## Ideas/Combinations:
The idea here is for us to have a lot of social tools, while still being (somewhat) useful as a support/controller in combat.

### Disguise Self + Friends:
- We don't really need advantage on charisma checks, but friends is basically a free way to aggro any being we encounter and displace that aggro with any being that we can mimic using disguise self (and maybe even some we couldn't with some backup deception rolls)
- Could be used socially to get information and instigate combat as a distraction

### Telepathic Speech + Dissonant Whispers (or Mind Sliver):
- If allowed by the DM this could allow us to fulfil the verbal component through telepathy, acting as a "free" subtle spell
- Could be used to again initiate combat without us being a clear initiator, or outright incapacitate weak targets with the psychic damage.
- With Dissonant Whispers, targets may flee and there is potential to use this as a distraction to move eyes/bodies away from social targets

### Mage Hand
- Just worth noting that our mage hand is invisible, does not require consentration, and can push people up to 5 feet, but does *not* prone them. We can push/pull allies out of danger, push enemies out of martial range.

---
# Level 2
We don't do much here. We get a first level spell slot and have lots of options depending on what we need at the given time. We also get 2 sorcerer points, but its effectively just an extra spell slot for now.

## Potential Spells
- Silent image for more illusions and trickery
- Charm Person for more social control or to potentially diffuse a tense situation
- Feather Fall if nobody else has it. Nobody wants to die to fall damage.

---
# Level 3
A more substantial upgrade as we get some more S/O spells, two rank 2 spell slots, as well as access to metamagic.

## S/O spells:
Based on raw rules we can swap out any of our S/O spells for any divination or enchantment spell from the Sorcerer, Wizard, and Warlock spell list. YMMV with different DMs on this.

By default we get:
### Calm Emotions:
- its pretty mediocre, and if allowed, there are a lot of great options to replace it. For flavor, my favored choice here would be Suggestion or Mind Whip
### Detect Thoughts:
- This is great for flavor. This allows you to pry information out of the target where as Telepathic Speech is essentially one-way unless the target willingly answers back. If your DM is really loose and allows Telepathic Speech to be abused, you could also swap this out for Suggestion, Mind Whip, or any other control/utility spell you can dig out of the relevant spell lists.

### Suggestion (optional)
- If you choose to replace Calm Emotions this is a great way to push thoughts into your targets mind. Suggestion (unlike something like Friends or Charm Person) leaves the target none the wiser to your meddling, so can be great for a cleaner social encounter. Potentially also used with Telepathic Speech, or Subtle Spell for even more sneaky results.

### Tasha's Mind Whip (optional)
- Mind Sliver on steroids, more damage if you feel like you're lacking potency in combat encounters


## Additional Spell Slots
We also get two level-2 spell slots on top of our S/O spells. This means we can learn one totally new spell, and replace a level-1 spell if we desire.
My intent is to fill a more supportive niche, so again which spells you take and swap kind of come down to flavor, party niche, and what suits the type of game you're playing.

If you didn't pick up optional spells as replacements for your S/O, I'd take those first. Other options would be:

### Vortex Warp
- Basically the magic hand push, but on steroids and it cant target you

### Misty Step
- See Vortex Warp, but only for you

### Invisibility
- Kind of goes against your flavor of charming and decieving your way in to places, but could be useful for allies or for areas where our charm and charisma are of no use


## Meta Magic
We get two meta magic options, but for flavor purposes we basically have to take subtle spell. Arguments could be made for a few other options, but my pick would either be quickened spell (essentially turns an action spell into a bonus action for some gross control combinations) or extended spell (to extend the effects of maybe a disguise, illuison, or even a control spell as we pick up ones where duration could be valuable)

- Subtle Spell
- Quickened Spell

---
# Level 4
Level 4 is the standard ability score/feature milestone. Depending on your starting stats, you may choose to bump up your charisma here, or choose a feature.

You also get another 2nd level spell slot and another known spell slot, pick up whatever you feel you need from the previous list.

If DM allows, you could swap out a cantrip at this point, and a metamagic style if needed

## Features
If taking a feature, there are a couple of cool options depending on what you feel is needed/wanted.

### Alert
- Metagamey for the most part, but a +5 to initiative is really good and could potentially allow us to shut down key targets, or even prevent encounters entirely with the right control spells/actions.
- Could be worked in if your character has or experiences some kind of trauma early on in the campaign.

### Fey Touched
- Free Misty Step if you didnt pick it up previously
- Access to any divination or enchantment spell (Command Maybe?)
- +1 to Charisma or another stat if you feel lacking

### Shadow Touched
- Free Invisibility
- Access to any necromancy or illusion spell. Any illusion spells you feel would be good for flavor, or possibly Cause Fear from necromancy?

### Telekenetic
- If you didn't start as a Variant Human and still feel the need for Mage Hand shennanigans, now is a perfect time to pick this up.
