## Description:
Vincent of Mintarn is a grifter at heart, a Mintarn born street urchin that has evolved their game to the highest level after years of studying everything from far-off royalty to the pirate lords that come to trade and bargian in Mintarn.
After a scam gone wrong (which involved the awakening of his latent sorcerer abilities) Vicent has fled Mintarn and now poses as pseudo-royalty, often found regaling false tales of being born to the inventors of famous ales, lagers, or even a distant relative of the current Tarnian Tyrant.
Vincent is still a novice sorcerer, still working to come to terms with his newfound ability, and wrapping his mind around the arcane as a whole.

---
## Motivations:
- Vicent is primarily driven by wealth and power, however fleeting they may be. There is no satisfaction in success as there is always a new scam right around the corner.
- Vincent wants to reconnect with his brothers and sisters, but won't do so as long as he knows there is a potential for his contact to lead the Emburhain family right to the people he cares about most.
- Vincent doesn't particularly care for his psionic abilities, but knows that he will likely have to master them to secure his future and put an end to the looming threat of the Embuirhan's over his head.

## Origin
Vincent was presumably abandoned at a young age, though his memories are few and far between. He was raised in a Tarnian orphanage and learned many of his practical skills in theivery/deception from his brothers and sisters. When not committing the usual petty crimes Vincent would sit high on the rooftops and watch as nobles, pirate lords, and all manners of royalty flowed through the Tarnian port. Eventually observation evolved into charming his way through the crowds, making conversation, picking pockets, boarding ships, and even feasting at their tables. 

On one of such occasions Vincent learned of a ship docked in the ports of Mintarn. The ship was carrying barrels of cured meats and grain from the mainlands - enough to have fed the family for months.
Vincent organized his brothers and sisters and executed a heist at night, but something went terribly wrong. Vincent doesn't have full recollection of that night, all he knows is that Ohrlan Embuirhan is dead, and the powerful and dangerous Embuirhan family thinks that he was involved.

## Relationships

### Tarnian Orphanage
- Vincent was raised in an orphanage with several brothers and sisters all participating in a variety of illicity activities to survive in the harsh environment they were raised. Vincent wants to reconnect with his brothers and sisters once he's able to return to Mintarn safely.

### Embuirhan Family
- The Embuirhans are a powerful family tied to one of the former Tyrants of Mintarn. While its unclear to what extent they believe Vincent to be involved, he knows that showing his face would certainly lead to his death.

## Personality

### General traits
- While Vincent is more than willing to defend himself when provoked, he's otherwise much more interested in solving his problems with words. 
- Vincent feels a kindred spirit to the poor and downtrodden and will be less willing to do any material harm to them, though harmless pranks and petty theft aren't off the table.
- Despite his uncanny ability to charm and blend in with nobility, he hates them and is much more willing to pursue darker means of manipulating those of wealth or status, even if it may be uncalled for, or to the detriment of himself or his current objective.
- Vincent has a streak of arrogance, and may be a bit too willing to believe he's gotten one over on his victims.

### Fears and trauma
- While Vincent can tolerate small, controlled flames such as torches or campfires, he becomes inconsolably fearful around large flames and explosions and may choose to flee or otherwise remove himself from the situation.
- Vincent is always fearful of his time in Mintarn catching up to him, and may be distrustful of those that claim to be from, or work within the region.

##  Favored Items
### Signet Ring
- Vincent wears ring on his left index finger. He stole this ring right off the hand of a duke while shmoozing his way through the Duke's party as the docked in Mintarn.
The ring has an inset engraving that can be removed and swapped, which Vincent often does to imply his relation to a variety of nobilities as needed. The original inset has been lost to time, so he only has ones he's had crafted, or stolen over time.

### Fine clothes
- Since fleeing Mintarn, Vincent values the clothes on his back quite highly as he expects it will be easier to integrate with and manipulate those around him if he's well dressed.
