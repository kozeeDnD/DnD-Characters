## Description:
Vincent of Mintarn is a grifter at heart, a Mintarn born street urchin that has evolved their game to the highest level after years of studying everything from far-off royalty to the pirate lords that come to trade and bargian in Mintarn.
After a scam gone wrong (which involved the awakening of his latent sorcerer abilities) Vicent has fled Mintarn and now poses as pseudo-royalty, often found regaling false tales of being born to the inventors of famous ales, lagers, or even a distant relative of the current Tarnian Tyrant.
Vincent is still a novice sorcerer, still working to come to terms with his newfound ability, and wrapping his mind around the arcane as a whole.

## Motivations:
- Vicent is primarily driven by wealth and power, however fleeting they may be. There is no satisfaction in success as there is always a new scam right around the corner.
- Despite his uncanny ability to pose as nobility, he hates them and is more than willing to lie and manipulate to their detriment, and sometimes even his own.
- Vincent is no robinhood, but he will often avoid bringing actual harm to those he feels a kindred spirit with (commoners and the "lower classes" of society), though light trickery, theft, and petty pranks are not off the table.
